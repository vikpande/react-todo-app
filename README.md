# To-do app using React, Redux and Thunk 
They say, no JS project is complete until you spin up your own version of "to-do"app. I did my bit too. Its a "To-do app" to manage your tasks effetively. 

## Getting Started

this project was created using "create-react-app"

## Requirements for starting the app:

Clone the repo : https://github.com/vikpande/react-todo-app.git

 - yarn 
 OR
 - npm install

 this installs all the dependencies for the app

## Starting the application

 - go to the right directory (`cd react-todo-app`)
 - start the client (`yarn start` or `npm run start`)

 look for your app on : http://localhost:3000/
